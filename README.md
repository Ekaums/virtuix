# virtuix
I had Initially found WolframAlpha while doing schoolwork, and I had the idea of using it to develop some "virtual assistant", that could answer questions, via inputting them into wolframalpha. 

This virtual assistant, which I have called Virtuix, also uses Wikipedia to provide a description about the answer, alongside the answer that is outputted from WolframAlpha.

Lastly, I have also implemented a text-to-speech that will read out the answer to the user.
